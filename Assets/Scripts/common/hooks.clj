;if the camera is flowing around the player, it should also avoid
;trespassing obstacles otherwise it will block the line-of-sight
;for a dynamic camera there are usually 7 degrees of freedom
;vertical
;horizontal
;distance
;field-of-view
;pitch
;yaw

; 4. Using a default camera distance likely to break LOS (10:48)
; 5. Allowing obstacles to break LOS from the side (11:41)
;    Detect obstacles with circular raycasts
;    Cinematography 30Â° rule (avoid jumpcut sensation)
; 8. Letting independent forces compete to push the camera (15:13)
;    Organize forces by degree-of-freedom at prioritizing by axis
; 9. Keeping narrow columns from breaking line-of-sight (16:31)
;    Tag obstacles that are allowed to break line-of-sight
;12. Swinging sideways when occluders come from behind (12:51)
;    Raycast behind the camera
;14. Using the same camera distance for all angles (20:36)
;    Use a spline to transition into a closeup
;    Worm's-eye leaves very little camera space
;    Bird's-eye reduces visibility, hiding horizon
;15. Using the same FOV for worm's eye and standard angles (21:56)
;16. Shifting pitch, distance, and FOV independently (22:40)
;    Distance and FOV should be derived from pitch, like gears
;
;17. Not cutting when the avatar passes through opaque areas (24:00)
;    i.e. a waterfall or some hidden passage
;21. Focusing only on the avatar (28:08)
;    Player need to see where they're going
;22. Relying on players to control the camera all the time (28:40)
;23. Leaving camera yaw alone while player is running (29:26)
;    Drift behind the avatar if they're running (unless walls)
;24. Making it hard to judge distances (30:28)
;25. Looking straight ahead as the avatar approaches a cliff (31:39)
;    Raycast looking for drops ahead the avatar
;26. Keeping the camera level when running on a slope (32:42)
;27. Misusing the "Rule of thirds" (37:26)
;    Framing things off-center can be pleasant (when still)
;    But don't pivot in-place, slide sideways to frame the avatar
;    Players use the center of the screen to aim!
;    Shadow of the Colossus is a exception (horse ride not= aim)
;28. Using the same logic for ground and air motion (35:28)
;    When jumping or flying look where to land
;    Modulate rule changes by the avatar's height above ground
;29. Relying entirely on procedural camera behaviours (36:34)
;    For special cases, us scripted "hints" to point yaw or pitch
;    Specially on small closed enviroments
;31. Rotating to look at nearby targets (39.17)
;    Move back or sideways to include targets in the view
;32. Translating to look at distant targets (40:22)
;    The only way to look at the sun is to rotate the camera
;33. Letting the avatar's own body occlude targets ahead (40:54)
;    A slight bird's eye view usually works fine
;34. Giving and taking control over the camera to the player (41:34)
;    Enable player to overwrite the hints whenever possible
;    Reduce the need for the player to control the camera
;35. Immediately applying a hint after the player control (42:12)
;    Let the camera rest for a moment or until the avatar moves
;37. Not providing a option to enable inverted controls (43:42) 
;39. Using linear sensitivity (45:37)
;    Analog sticks don't have much range
;    Use an "S" curve to allow players to make small adjustments     
;40. Letting the camera pivot drift too far (46:23)
;    Get smooth motions by letting the avatar drift slightly 
;    Limit how far the camera can drift
;41. Using a small field-of-view (47:15)
;    Beware simulation sickness (aka Portal 1 & 2 wtf)
;42. Rapidly shifting field-of-view (49:39)
;    Foward-backward motion = simulation sickness
;45. Translating or rotating up and down when jumping (52:02)
;    The camera can ignore temporary vertical motion
;    When moving from platforms the camera can lazily adapt
;46. Rapidly transitioning to a new camera position (53:16)
;    Cut if necessary
;47. Maintaning pitch speed until hitting the pitch limit
;    Stopping abruptly triggers sickness
;    Use an inverted "S" curve (or a low pass filter step response)
;END The devil is the details (Good luck!)
